LCS: To find a long consecutive subsequence in an arrays.

approach:
map a hashMap of element and bool , intially it all be true.
then loop through array...and pick each element now go back
by decrementing and see the number it present or not keep the count of length
and keep going backward it the number is not present and keep setting the visited value to false;
repeate the process of forward also...
and if the curr max length is greater than the total max length ,update and 
and if it is equal find which comes first.
